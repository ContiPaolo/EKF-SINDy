## Abstract
We propose a framework that combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) for online data assimilation and model adaptation of nonlinear dynamic systems. SINDy is employed to identify the system dynamics directly from data, thus mitigating potential biases due to incorrect modeling assumptions and providing a computationally efficient, physically interpretable model. By treating states, parameters and SINDy model coefficients as random variables, the EKF enables joint state-parameter estimation, allowing real-time updates to adapt the model to time-varying conditions or unforeseen events. This approach not only facilitates efficient model sensitivity evaluation but also ensures robust operation beyond the original training range of SINDy. Overall, this method offers a data-driven, easy-to-apply strategy for dynamic model identification, making it well-suited for handling time-varying, nonlinear systems with reduced epistemic uncertainty.
